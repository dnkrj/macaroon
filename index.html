			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<p class="text">
 				Macaroon was set up by Rowena Macrae who was born and bred in Scotland and has spent much of her life up in the Highlands. Among her favourite past times are walking the hills (whatever the weather!) in the hope of catching a trout, lobster potting, picking mussels and bobbing around on Loch Duich for hours on end fishing for mackerel. The excitement of seeing what was caught, pulled up or picked is almost as great now as it was growing up. Serving up a delicious supper or lunch out of what she caught is the most rewarding, not to say delicious, experience.

 				 After leaving school she went to The Grange cookery course in Frome, Somerset where she gained a cookery qualification. Since the course she has used what she learnt there to do two ski seasons and many cooking jobs all over the country and abroad in her university holidays. Since then has since been in London working in a number of sectors, starting in travel, moving on to property and most recently PR. Her heart has always been set on setting up her own business and she realised she would never be satisfied until then so Macaroon was born!
